  <h2> About Us </h2>
  <p> Bitesize PhD is lunchtime seminar series run by PhD students, for PhD students.
    Established in 2012 at the University of East Anglia.
    These semianrs are a great chance for PhD students to practice presenting, challenge and
    develop each others ideas and keep up to date with the wide variety of research happening across the university. Most of the presentations are connected in some way to medicine or health, in the broadest sense and our presenters are mostly from MED, HSC, BIO and PHA schools.
